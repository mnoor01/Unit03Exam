# Unit03Exam mid-unit assessment
I was able to do all aspects of it except I couldn't figure out how to put my list in the recyclerview adapter  because I am
so use to having a different adapter class.
I was familiar with intents and shared prefernces.
I feel like I have a lot to improve on when it comes to recyclerViews.
